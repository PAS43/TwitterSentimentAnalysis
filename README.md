# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
This uses a data set with 1 million Tweets to build a model using Keras for sentiment analysis of Tweets 

I have used a 960m to train on but this card is only 2GB and can only really handel about 30,000 ish tweets at a time depending on the network size

The dataset i used is here,
